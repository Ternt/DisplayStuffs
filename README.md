# DisplayStuffs
Recently, I took a course about Computer Graphics, learning webGL and Javascript. Wanting to continue my journey into computer graphics, I decided to create this project, which I thoughtfully called... *drumroll*... DisplayStuffs :). The past week, I focused on getting a simple OBJ parser feature implemented. Now that is done, I'm working towards creating a matrix library with some additional Quaternion algebra stuff for 3D rotations.
